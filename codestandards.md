## Universal Coding Standards?

I actually enjoy using ESLint immensely. I struggled to get ESLint to work initially, so I had to do a few practice problems without using ESLint. When I finally got ESLint to work, doing practice problems and getting the green checkmark was very helpful. Two of my most repressing habits as a programmer is not carefully naming variables, and not paying attention to formatting errors that may cause a problem, such as not including a closed curly bracket. Using JSFiddle forced me to pay more attention to these bad habits since it does not throw any errors. So, JSFiddle certainly improved these skills for me, but now, using ESLint is helping me improve even more. 

Although coding standards can seem trivial, and some may say “if the code works who cares how it’s formatted? ”, I don't agree with this at all! I think all programmers should refer to the same coding standards and format their code similarly so their code is accessible and easy for anyone to read. Perhaps for veteran programmers, it is easy to discern what each line of code in a program is doing, but for beginners comments and formatting is vital for understanding a program.

ESLint is also easy to use, at first it is a bit annoying not having a green checkmark because you forgot a space after a double backslash for a comment, once you see that error a few times, you won’t forget to add a space again. The errors it shows are very clear and concise as well. I learned to program using eclipse, and I often had to look up error messages because I didn’t know what the message meant, this obviously takes quite a lot of time and time is not plentiful during a timed WOD. ESLint’s errors make it easy to get the green checkmark; if the errors weren’t so easy to understand, I might have a problem with ESLlint.
