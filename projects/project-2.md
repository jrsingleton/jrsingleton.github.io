In April 2015, I was hired as the photographer for a wedding. There was a significant amount of planning involved in this project, as well as managing attendees' positions and overseeing my assistant photographer. I was in charge of coordinating where and when group photos would take place, which guests my client's preferred photos with, and consulting to agree on key moments to capture.

I was also responsible for editing the photos with PhotoShop and Lightroom. Editing includes correcting white balance, exposure, and making photos more aesthetically pleasing. Photographing a wedding leads to a library of hundreds of photos, my final count was 543. Each photo must be edited in similar ways so there isn't any incongruence. After editing, the photos must be formatted for printing or for displaying on a screen.

Overall this project lasted about a month.
