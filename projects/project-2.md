In March 2017 I was hired as the photographer for a wedding. There was a significant amount of planning involved in this project, as well as managing attendees positions and overseeing my assistant photographer. 

I was also responsible for editing the photos with PhotoShop and Lightroom.

Overall this project lasted about a month.
