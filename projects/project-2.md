In March 2017 I was hired as the photographer for a wedding. There was a significant amount of planning involved in this project, as well as managing attendees positions and overseeing my assistant photographer. I was in charge of coordinating where and when group photos would take place, which guests my client's preferred photos with, and consulting to agree on key moments to capture. 

I was also responsible for editing the photos with PhotoShop and Lightroom. Editting includes correcting white balance, exposure, and making photos more asthetically pleasing. Photographing a wedding leads to a library of hundreds of photos, my final count was 543. Each photo must be editted in similar ways so there isn't any incongruence. After editting, the photos must be formatted for printing or for displaying on a screen.

Overall this project lasted about a month.
