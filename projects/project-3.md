The user presses 'okay' and the directory appears. User is prompted to enter a patients name, pain triage, insurance coverage, and total balance owed. From here the user has a few options.

They can add the patient to the directory, clear the text boxes with 'cancel', find or remove a patient by name, list all patients in the directory, list all patients without insurance, or list all patients with a specific balance.
