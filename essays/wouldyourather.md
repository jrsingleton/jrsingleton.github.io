## The Moral Dilemma

Imagine this: You are at a restaurant and you notice your friend’s wife on what seems like a date. 
Should you tell your friend and possibly ruin his marriage? Or, should you turn a blind eye?

While considering how you would react, it may help to imagine the ripple effect your decision may make.
In [Schrodinger's cat thought experiment](https://news.berkeley.edu/2014/07/30/watching-schrodingers-cat-die/),
the cat is both dead and alive at the same time while it is in the box, but when you open the box, you kill the cat.
Following the same logic, since you don’t know if your friends wife being unfaithful or not, you may “kill the cat” by telling 
your friend. But what if not telling your friend leads to worse heartache down the line? Perhaps there is hubris in the idea that something does not exist if you don't profess it. Nevertheless, this is a very sticky 
moral dilemma; there are pros and cons for each choice. The choice and reasoning you ultimately decide on 
demonstrates your sense of ethics. If you follow the Association for Computing Machinery 
[Code of Ethics](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics), you may decide to tell your friend because you value
honesty and trustworthiness.
If you are a moral realist that believes there are moral facts, any moral proposition is either true 
or false. The [universal modus ponens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modus_ponens)
rule of inference can be used to demonstrate the proposition below

- Lying is wrong. 
- If you omit the truth, then you are lying.
- Therefore;
- Omitting the truth is wrong. 

## The Ethical Software Engineer

I would argue that being ethical and following morals is important in nearly all decisions a person will 
have to make, but personal ethics are highly subjective. So, a universal code of ethics must be used 
professionally, in software engineering this is the [Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional 
Practice](https://www.computer.org/education/code-of-ethics). This isn’t necessarily a set of commandments,
it is more so a guide to help you make ethical professional decisions. Ethics usually means the same thing
no matter the context, ethics are moral principles that govern a person's behavior or the conduct of an activity.
Some moral principles of an ethical software engineer are to; never advertently or inadvertently cause harm to 
the public, their clients, colleagues, and employers, and always create products of the best possible standards.
This code of ethics is created for software engineers, but it can be used in other places in your life as well; as was demonstrated in the thought experiment above

## Ethical Analysis of a Hypothetical Situation

For the sake of this analysis, I am a software engineer on a team that is tasked with developing the 
navigation algorithm for a self-driving car, and I want to follow the standards of the [ACM Code](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics) and the [SE Code](https://www.computer.org/education/code-of-ethics). First, I consider any and all possible negative impacts of
my computing. My navigation algorithm will take in a lot of sensitive data; photographs and video 
recorded may contain sensitive information of bystanders or my client,  and location information of 
the car may reveal my clients “usual” routes. If my navigation algorithm is accessed by someone who 
is unauthorized, they could potentially take control of the vehicle and cause a great deal of unjust harm to my client, the public, and property.
A vehicle can be a destructive weapon in the wrong hands, it must be extremely secure. To minimize death 
or injury in an unavoidable accident, I must follow the generally accepted best practices, unless there 
is a compelling ethical reason to change it. 


Some of the moral dilemmas I would face working on the navigation algorithm are straight out of a philosophy text book.
Storing the sensitive data would be absolutely necessary, that data could be used to assist the passenger, and improve the safety and efficiency of the algorithm. As long as the correct precautions are implemented to maintain complete confedentiality of all sensitive data, and only collect the minimum ammount of personal information necessary, I would be respecting privacy and maintaining morality. There is no “right” answer for the question of handling an unavoidable accident. 
Vehicles are often marketed by how safe they keep the people inside the vehicle, not how little 
damage they will do to people outside of the vehicle.
