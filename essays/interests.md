## Personal Interests and Goals
<img class="ui tiny right spaced image" src="../images/degree_difficulty.jpg">*Difficulty: a thing that is hard to accomplish, deal with, or understand.*

Software engineering is a very interesting field of study. It is also an indescribably useful skill to have. During my time studying software development, I hope to greatly improve my programming skills and problem-solving skills. 

Personally, I am very interested in artificial intelligence. I don’t currently possess significant experience in the field of artificial intelligence but I hope to gain experience soon; I plan to graduate with a minor in psychology. Psychology may seem far from relevant in the field of computer science, but I see the two fields connecting in several ways. Cognitive computing is particularly interesting to me, basically, cognitive computing involves simulating the human thought process through programs or models to help us solve problems. Deep learning is also related to artificial intelligence, it relies on artificial neural networks. Of course, I cant discuss interests in artificial intelligence without mentioning the horror inducing paths artificial intelligence may go down (think about the AI robot Sophia mentioning destroying humans). Perhaps I will one day save the world from “iRobots”.

Apart from artificial intelligence, I am also interested in data security and security science. Cybersecurity is another extremely important field in my eyes. The culture of internet oversharing and spreading personal data has increased immensely over the last few years and I only see it getting more prevalent. Once your eyes are opened to the ways our data is bought and sold it’s hard to feel safe, but I would love to learn more about data security and possibly pursue a career in the field.
