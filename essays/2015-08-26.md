  Javascript seems like a fairly simple programming language. I am a newbie with regards to Javascript, although I have a good amount of practice with java. You might expect Javascript and Java to be almost identical but there are key differences. Java is object-oriented programming; you create classes (objects) and you can manipulate the class in different ways by making an instance of the object. Java is a programming language, but Javascript is a completely different type of language, it’s a scripting language. The main difference in using a scripting language seems to be that the scripting does not need to be compiled like a programming language, and it is also significantly less code-intensive. Javascript being a loose language, meaning it may do what you intend for it to do even with some errors, makes it easy to make functions as long as you have the right technique. 
  
  It is difficult for me to determine how functional or effective javascript is from a software engineering perspective, as I don’t have a significant amount of experience in software engineering. Although I notice that the same things that make Javascript easy for beginners also lead to problems. The looseness leaves a lot of room for error because it doesn’t prevent errors the way Java does. An example of this is that Javascript does not throw an error if there is no semicolon following each line, this allows you to run the program without an error, but without throwing an error it may be difficult to find the source of your problem.

  Athletic software engineering is quite fun. I personally enjoy problem-solving and I get a lot of gratification from solving a difficult problem. The only thing I don't like about it is the time limit, I understand that the time limit is necessary for grading purposes as well as testing your proficiency, but being in a time constraint is stressful and I find that I start to worry about running out of time and that distracts me from solving the problem. Even though it’s challenging for me I’m glad I’m getting experience in competitive software engineering because I need to practice to get through it. The practice WOD’s are very helpful, they do a great job at getting your brain into the programming mindset.
