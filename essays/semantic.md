My Semantic UI journey has not been the smoothest. To begin, I attempted to install Semantic UI with Gulp in the command line; the result was a long list of errors. I spent about four hours trying different methods to fix the errors, including uninstalling all Node and Gulp files and reinstalling them from scratch. In this process, I managed to create a whole different problem that I had to resolve. After all of this hassle, one of my peers informed me that he had the same errors, but Semantic UI still works as long as it is linked in the head of the index file. The time wasted was quite painful but I learned more about utilizing the command line in the process.

In my current state of expertise with HTML and CSS, I am finding Semantic UI to be quite difficult. Combining the bits of confusion about HTML that linger in my mind, with the large amounts of confusion I have about Semantic UI can be a bit catastrophic. I find myself implementing certain pieces of web development in convoluted ways, my more experienced peer may do what I did in 5 lines, in only one line. It is difficult to wrap my head around, but no where near impossible. Mastering Semantic will certainly require a good amount of time and effort on my part.

Despite all of my own negative experiences, I can see how Semantic UI will be very useful in the future. It makes elaborate HTML code much more readable once you have some understanding of the denotations of Semantic. After the time and frustration, Semantic seems to make implementing certain styles and elements in web development easier, and it comes with a huge variety of components and themes.
