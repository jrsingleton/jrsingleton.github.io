## The Moral Dilemma

Imagine this: You are at a restaurant and notice your friend’s wife on what seems like a date.
Should you tell your friend and possibly ruin his marriage?

If you follow the logic of the Schrodinger's cat thought experiment, since you don’t know if the wife is 
cheating or not, you “kill the cat” by telling your friend. But what if not telling your friend leads to
worse heartache down the line? This is a very sticky moral dilemma; there are many pros and cons for each 
choice and the choice and reasoning you decide on shows your sense of ethics. If you are a moral realist 
that believes there are moral facts, any moral proposition is either true or false. The universal modus 
ponens argument form can be used to demonstrate this proposition: 

- Lying is wrong. 
- If you omit the truth, then you are lying. 
   Therefore
- Omitting the truth is wrong. 

I would argue that being ethical and following morals is important in nearly all decisions a person will 
have to make, but personal ethics are highly subjective. So, a universal code of ethics must be used 
professionally, in software engineering this is the Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional 
Practice. This isn’t necessarily a set of commandments, it is more so a guide to help you make ethical 
professional decisions. Ethics usually means the same thing no matter the context, ethics are moral
principles that govern a person's behavior or the conduct of an activity. Some moral principles of an 
ethical software engineer are to; never advertently or inadvertently cause harm to the public, their 
clients, colleagues, and employers, and always create products of the best possible standards.

For the sake of this analysis, I am a software engineer on a team that is tasked with developing the 
navigation algorithm for a self-driving car. First, I consider any and all possible negative impacts of
my computing. My navigation algorithm will take in a lot of sensitive data; photographs and video 
recorded may contain sensitive information of bystanders or my client,  and location information of 
the car may reveal my clients “usual” routes.  If my navigation algorithm is accessed by someone who 
is unauthorized, they could cause a great deal of unjust harm to my client, the public, and property.
A vehicle can be a destructive weapon in the wrong hands, it must be extremely secure. To minimize death 
or injury in an unavoidable accident, I must follow the generally accepted best practices, unless there 
is a compelling ethical reason to change it. 

Some of the moral dilemmas I would face working on the navigation algorithm are straight out of a 
philosophy text book (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem). The sensitive data is necessary, 
it would be important to store that data to improve the algorithm, so I don't see maintaining access
to the information as unethical as long as there are precautions to have all data remain 
confidential. There is no “right” answer for the question of handling an unavoidable accident. 
Vehicles are often marketed by how safe they keep the people inside the vehicle, not how little 
damage they will do to people outside of the vehicle.
